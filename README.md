## Features

&#8226; Add new books, posters or audiovisuals: User can add new items to the library by entering their details, such as title, author and more depending on actually selected work type (ISBN number, width and height, duration).  
&#8226; Unique ID assignment: System automatically assigns a unique ID to each new item that is added to the library.   
&#8226; Borrow, return, or delete existing works from library collection: User can borrow, return or delete items by entering their unique ID.  
&#8226; ISBN-13 checksum: Program implements the checksum algorythm that ensures the given ISBN number is valid.

In this example, a book is added, and then removed. User must provide author's name, title and ISBN number.
